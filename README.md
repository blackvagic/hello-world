Hey, y'all. 

I have no idea what I'm doing but I sure would like to learn some of this fancy computerin'. 
Ever since the coal mines shut down and I had to pawn my jaw harp, I've been meanin' to make myself all useful like.
The future is scary but it ain't no haint so buck up, buttercup, 'cause here we fuckin' go.
